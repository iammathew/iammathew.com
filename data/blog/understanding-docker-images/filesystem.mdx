# How Docker images are built

## Why it's not as simple as you think

Looking at the following Dockerfile one might assume the resulting image might be smaller than the original ubuntu image.

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN rm -rf /usr
```

But in reality, it's larger in size. The reason for this is the way images are stored and built.

## Introducing layers

Docker uses a category of file systems called union file systems, more specifically OverlayFS.
OverlayFS works by overlaying one or several read-only directory trees (`lowerdir1` and `lowerdir2`) and a single (or none) writable directory tree (`upperdir`), resulting in a merged single writable directory tree (`merged`).

Let's look at the following imaginary OverlayFS filesystem. Be aware we always operate on the `merged` view of the directory tree.

### Scenario 1: Reading `file1`

When trying to read/access `file1` in the `merged` directory tree, it will actually read `file1` of `lowerdir1`.

### Scenario 2: Reading `file2`

When trying to read/access `file2` in the `merged` directory tree, it will actually read `file2` of `lowerdir1`.
Even though `file2` is both present in `lowerdir1` and `lowerdir2` the upper layers will "overlay" the layers below.

### Scenario 3: Overwriting `file1`

When overwriting an already existing file inside the `merged` directory tree, like `file1` in this example, the base file in `lowerdir1` won't actually be overwritten (Remember: All lowerdirs are always read-only), instead a new copy with the edits made will be created inside `upperdir`, leaving the base file untouched.

### Scenario 4: Deleting `file3`

When deleting an file that exists in one of the `lowerdir`, a so called "whiteout" file is created (inside a special overlayfs directory) which marks the file as deleted. Inside the `merged` directory tree, no file will be present.

**Attention:** When deleting a file inside the `upperdir`, the file will actually be deleted.

### Scenario 5: Creating `file4`

When creating a new file, the file will be created inside the `upperdir` directory tree.

![OverlayFS](/static/images/OverlayFSScenario5.svg 'OverlayFS Scenario 5')

### Summary

- All writes or deletes always happen on the `upperdir` (or in case there is none, they will fail).
- All reads will access the file inside the most upper layer, in which it exists.

## Why docker images can't decrease in size

Using this newly gained knowledge of how OverlayFS works, let's go back to our original observation of the docker image that can't decrease in size.

Docker images are built out of layers, which map to dirs/layers in OverlayFS. Each build instruction inside a Dockerfile will first start a new container mounting an OverlayFS as root filesystem with all previously built layers as lowerdirs (read-only) and a newly created layer as upperdir (read/write).
Once the build step is completed (in the above case `rm -rf /usr`) it will commit the upperdir as a new readonly layer/lowerdir.

Therefore the above docker image will actually be larger in size due to a new layer that contains white-out files.

## The next step

In the second part of this series we will explore, what to do, in order to keep docker images small, leveraging the knowledge of how the docker filesystem works.
